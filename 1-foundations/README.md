## üè∑ HTML foundations
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure and content of webpages.

HTML has a vast list of predefined tags `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element` that you can use to create all kinds of different elements. It is important to `use the correct tags for content`. Using the correct tags can have 2 big impacts: `how they are ranked in search engines`; and `how accessible they are to users` who rely on assistive technologies, like screen readers, to use the internet. Using the correct elements for content is called `semantic HTML`. 

We should always name the HTML file that will contain the homepage of our websites index.html. This is because web servers will by default look for an index.html page when users land on our websites - and not having one will cause big problems.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

The latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is simply <!DOCTYPE html>.

In the above boilerplate, `lang` specifies the language of the text content in that element - primarily used for improving accessibility of the webpage. It allows assistive technologies, for example screen readers, to adapt according to the language and invoke correct pronunciation.

The `<head>` element is where we put important `meta-information` about our webpages, and `stuff required to be rendered correctly` in the browser. Inside the <head>, we should not use any element that displays content on the webpage. The head element goes within the HTML element and should always be the first element under the opening <html> tag. 

HTML validators `https://validator.w3.org/`, or `https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html` ensure your markup is correct and are an excellent learning tool, as they provide feedback on syntax errors you may be making often and aren‚Äôt aware of, such as missing closing tags and extra spaces in your HTML.

The `<strong>` element makes text bold. It also semantically marks text as important; `this affects tools, like screen readers, that users with visual impairments will rely on to use your website`. The em element makes text italic. It also semantically places emphasis on the text, which again may affect things like screen readers. 

It is recommended to indent any child elements by `two spaces`.

You can use anchor tags to link to any kind of resource on the internet, not just other HTML documents. You can link to videos, pdf files, images, and so on, but for the most part, you will be linking to other HTML documents. Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called `absolute links`. Links to other pages within our own website are called `relative links`, such as `<a href="pages/about.html">About</a>`. In many cases, this will work just fine; however, you can still run into unexpected issues with this approach. Prepending ./ before the link will in most cases prevent such issues, such as: `<a href="./pages/about.html">About</a>`

The src attribute in img tag can embed an image using both absolute and relative paths. The alt attribute is used to describe an image. It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded. It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users.

File structure: avoid using spaces in file/folder names, avoid using digits, avoid using capitalized letters. 

There‚Äôs four main image formats in use on the web: JPG (handles large color palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size, do not allow for transparent pixels), GIF (simple animations, limited in color palette, binary transparency, cannot have semi-opaque pixels), PNG(bigger than jpg of same quality, allow opacity, great for icons, tech diagrams, logos) and SVG (vector-based, great for responsive design, use them whenever you can. But, if your images contain a lot of text, can have a big impact on file size). 

When writing code, it‚Äôs considered best practice to commit every time you have a meaningful change in the code. This will create a timeline of your progress and show that your finished code didn‚Äôt appear out of nowhere.

The seven rules of a great Git commit message: (ref: `https://cbea.ms/git-commit/`)
1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

Using VSCode as your text editor will allow you to easily make multi-line commit messages, easily see the character length of each line, and will allow you to use VSCode spell check extensions (Code Spell Checker) to make sure your spelling is correct. 

## üè∑ CSS foundations
### Selectors
Universal Selector - select elements of any type, hence the name ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù, and the syntax for it is a simple asterisk. In the example below, every element would have the color: purple; style applied to it.
```css
* {
  color: purple;
}
```

Type Selectors - select all elements of the given element type, and the syntax is just the name of the element.

Class Selectors - select all elements with the given class, which is just an attribute you place on an HTML element. Syntax: a period immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the class attribute. Another thing you can do with the class attribute is to add multiple classes to a single element as a space-separated list, such as `class="alert-text severe-alert"`. Since whitespace is used to separate class names like this, you should never use spaces for multi-worded names and should use a hyphen instead.

ID Selectors - Instead of a period, we use a hashtag immediately followed by the case-sensitive value of the ID attribute. The major difference between classes and IDs is that an element can only have one ID. An ID cannot be repeated on a single page.

You could group selectors (comma separated), chain selectors (no separator between chains), combine selectors (space separated, A descendant combinator will only cause elements that match the last selector to be selected if they also have an ancestor that matches the previous selector). 

`font-family` can be a single value or a comma-separated list of values that determine what font an element uses. Each font will fall into one of two categories, either a ‚Äúfont family name‚Äù like `"Times New Roman"` (we use quotes due to the whitespace between words) or a ‚Äúgeneric family name‚Äù like `sans-serif` (generic family names never use quotes). If a browser cannot find or does not support the first font in a list, it will use the next one, then the next one and so on until it finds a supported and valid font. This is why it‚Äôs best practice to include a list of values for this property, starting with the font you want to be used most and ending with a generic font family as a fallback, e.g. `font-family: "Times New Roman", sans-serif;`.

It‚Äôs best to include `both width and height` for `<img>` elements, even if you don‚Äôt plan on adjusting the values from the image file‚Äôs original ones. When these values aren‚Äôt included, if an image takes longer to load than the rest of the page contents, the image won‚Äôt take up any space on the page at first, but will suddenly cause a drastic shift of the other page contents once it does load in. Explicitly stating a height and width prevents this from happening, as space will be ‚Äúreserved‚Äù on the page and will just appear as a blank space until the image loads.

Inheritance refers to certain CSS properties that, when applied to an element, are inherited by that element‚Äôs descendants, even if we don‚Äôt explicitly write a rule for those descendants. Typography based properties (`color`, `font-size`, `font-family`, etc.) are usually inherited, while most other properties aren‚Äôt. The exception to this is when directly targeting an element, as this always beats inheritance. 

The Styles pane in the Chrome Developer Tools allows you to edit styles directly in the browser, so you can see the changes immediately (responds in real-time). It is extremely useful for quickly testing out various attributes and values without needing to reload the page over and over again.
